# Web Infrastructure Design

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

This project focuses on designing scalable and robust web infrastructures. You will conceptualize and illustrate realistic web architectures to support high-traffic websites, addressing concerns such as load balancing, redundancy, scalability, and monitoring. The emphasis is on understanding how components interact across layersâ€”from DNS resolution to database replicationâ€”while optimizing for fault tolerance and performance.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will learn to:

- Design scalable and highly available web infrastructures.
- Explain how DNS, firewalls, load balancers, and web servers interact.
- Model replication between database servers (MySQL primary/replica).
- Integrate monitoring and understand system limitations.
- Create detailed architecture diagrams using tools like `draw.io`.

## ðŸ“Œ Tasks

### Task 0: Simple Web Stack

**Objective**: Design a basic web infrastructure.

**Requirements**:
- 1 client accesses `www.foobar.com`
- DNS resolves to the Load Balancer IP
- Load balancer forwards traffic to a single web server
- Web server is connected to a single MySQL database
- The database and web server share application files

**Expected Outcome**:
A simple, linear design showing DNS â†’ Load Balancer â†’ Web Server â†’ MySQL.

---

### Task 1: Distributed Web Infrastructure

**Objective**: Add redundancy to the web infrastructure.

**Requirements**:
- Multiple web servers
- Load balancing across web servers
- Redundant database servers (with one set as replica)
- Each web server connects to the primary DB

**Expected Outcome**:
A fault-tolerant design with multiple web servers and a replicated database setup.

---

### Task 2: Secured and Monitored Infrastructure

**Objective**: Add firewalls, HTTPS, and monitoring.

**Requirements**:
- Firewalls between components (clientâ€“LB, LBâ€“web, webâ€“DB)
- SSL certificate on Load Balancer (HTTPS traffic)
- Monitoring agents on all servers

**Expected Outcome**:
A production-ready design with basic security and health monitoring.

---

### Task 3: Scale Up

**Objective**: Horizontal scaling of backend services.

**Requirements**:
- Add a third web server (Server C)
- Maintain load balancing (HAProxy cluster)
- Add a third MySQL replica
- Reflect all arrows including HTTPS responses

**Expected Outcome**:
A highly scalable and redundant system with multiple app/db servers and detailed data flows.

## ðŸ›  Tools

- [Draw.io](https://draw.io) or diagrams.net for network schematics
- Markdown for documentation
- `PNG` exports of each design for visual presentation

## ðŸ§© Notes

- All components must be explicitly represented (e.g., firewalls, DB replicas).
- Arrows must indicate both directions of data flow when needed.
- Realistic IPs and hostnames are encouraged for clarity.
- You can use custom icons or emoji for better visual representation.
